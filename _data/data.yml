  summary: |
    I am an experienced Full-Stack Developer with a demonstrated history of working in both consulting and in-house 
    development roles. My expertise spans across managing complex distributed systems, particularly within microservices 
    architectures. With proficiency in Java, Angular, Hibernate, and the entire CI/CD pipeline, I excel in environments 
    requiring containerization tools like Docker and orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

    In addition to my technical skills, I have consistently contributed as a Scrum Master, leading teams in agile development,
    ensuring the timely and quality delivery of products, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement. My certifications 
    in Scrum and AWS further solidify my capabilities in both software engineering and team leadership.

    I thrive on solving intricate problems, ensuring that client expectations are not only met but exceeded, and driving 
    efficiency across all phases of the software development lifecycle.
